AI: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming various industries.
|-Machine Learning (ML): Focuses on algorithms
||--Supervised Learning: Involves training models with labeled data
|||--Classification: Assigning data points to predefined categories
|||--Regression: Predicting numerical values
||--Unsupervised Learning: Deals with unlabeled data
|||--Clustering: Grouping similar data points together
|||--Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features in data
||--Deep Learning: Subset of ML that uses neural networks
|||--Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs): Inspired by biological neurons
|||--Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Used for image and video analysis
|||--Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Used for sequential data like text and time series
